# notes
- due to incompetence on whoevers part, the pdf is completely fucked up in many places
- we weren't able to find the exact issue, only solution was to yeet it through pdftk -.-
- now the installed java on the server is broken too, therefore the pdftk-java-port can't be used
- because just trying to compile from source was a pain in the ass (libgcj libgcj-devel: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_for_Java, whatever), we grabbed a precompiled version from the first github we found
